### Development

A `.env` file is required that defines the following variables:
`CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN`. An example env file is provided that can be copied and replaced with actual values.

You can use `gatsby develop` to run a development build of the project and `gatsby build` to create a build that includes all the static content that would be deployed.
