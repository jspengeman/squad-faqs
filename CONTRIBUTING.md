# Development

If you'd like to fix a bug or add a feature go ahead and open up an issue describing your intentions. We can then discuss the task and provide any help needed prior to getting started on the task.

# Translations

Our content is hosted on Contentful which allows us to support localization of our content. If you'd like to translate the content to another locale that would be a huge help.

# Donations

Running Squad FAQs is done in a completely free manner. We use Netlify for hosting which is free and for our content management system we use Contentful's free tier. The downside is that the free tier on Contentful only supports two different locales so we will never be able to support more than two different languages. The "Small" tier is 189 USD a month, if we can get enough interest in donating the Squad FAQs team will look into moving to the "Small" tier to support more translations.
